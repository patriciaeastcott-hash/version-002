                    <p>DigitalABCs wasn’t born in a boardroom. It was born from the real-world struggles of our founder,
                        Trish, a single mum of two. After COVID, she faced the daunting challenge of re-entering a
                        workforce that had been transformed by automation. She saw firsthand how technology could feel
                        like a barrier—a tool for corporate giants, not for everyday people.</p>
                    <p>She experienced the frustration of workplace micromanagement and the inefficiency of systems that
                        were meant to help but only made things more complicated. She knew there had to be a better way.
                    </p>
                    <p>Instead of being pushed out, Trish pushed back. She dedicated herself to learning AI and
                        automation, not to climb a corporate ladder, but to build a ladder for others. She discovered
                        that AI wasn't something to be feared; it was a tool that could give power back to employees,
                        communities, and small businesses.</p>
                    <p><strong>DigitalABCs is the result of that journey.</strong></p>
